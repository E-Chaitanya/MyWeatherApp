üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Clone the repository:

cd MyAndroidWeatherApp

Open in Android Studio:

Launch Android Studio.

Select File > Open and navigate to the MyAndroidWeatherApp (or weather-whisper-visuals-main) directory you just cloned.

API Key Configuration (If applicable):

If the app uses a weather API that requires a key (most do), you will need to obtain one from the respective provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Create a secrets.properties file in your project's root (or as instructed by the API provider) and add your API key there.

API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

(Adjust these instructions based on how your app actually handles API keys.)
